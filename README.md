# Metrak
My personal media tracker. A.k.a. _a Letterboxd clone_. Although, with the possibility of tracking media other than movies.  
It is a project I chose to build in order to learn and practice my **Ruby** and **Ruby on Rails** skills.

It has been deployed using [Fly](https://fly.io), but the deployed version still present _broken_ UI due to problems with the JavaScript code.
I used [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) as a UI component, which doesn't seem to be the most deployable library.

## Run locally
If you want to try it locally with the _unbroken_ UI, download the repo and run:
```bash
$ bundle install
$ rails s
```

## Future plans
&#9744; Rebuild UI using different component library (_not likely_)
or
&#9744; Turn it into an API-only app (_very likely_)
